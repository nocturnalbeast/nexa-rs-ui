# Nexa RS UI

A rainmeter geek's take on several minimal user interface layouts. A hobby project that gives an overlay UI on top of Windows shell using Rainmeter.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You'll need only one thing, and that is Rainmeter.

### Installing

Download or clone this repository to get started with the installation.

Once done, the folder should be placed in your Rainmeter skins directory.
Normally, (on a standard installation) it should point to the following path:

```
C:\Users\"username"\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\
```

The above is the case for Windows 7 and above. On Windows XP it'll be like this:

```
C:\Documents And Settings\"username"\My Documents\Rainmeter\Skins
```

Then launch Rainmeter and select the required modules for use.
